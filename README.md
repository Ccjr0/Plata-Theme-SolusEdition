# Plata-Theme-SolusEdition
The default custom Plata theme that comes installed with Solus 4 Fortitude / Ubuntu Budgie Edition - For the people too lazy/inexperienced to edit the material code (like myself).

Keep in mind that you can extract the theme from the /usr/share/themes file in Solus, or the LiveUSB OS (Which is what I did), but this repo aims for convinience, and safekeeping.
